TABLE TABLE TABLE TABLE!

# This table was built as one of the tools in a suite that I am working on putting together in a collection
## It allows the user to add / remove and edit the entries of each data row
## as well as showing the status of each of the given rows

#### I'm terrible at writing Readme files for my own stuff. Have a table
